Microservices
Monolite vs microservices
when we are using microservices architecture we divede our app on small services and instead of redeploying whole app 
we need just redeploy one particular service 
Also we are able to scale our application and have deployed several instances at the same time and manage all calls with load balancers

In monolith we have got specific problem and solution. For example how this shoping card service will be called from shoping catalog service
it is specific problem in monolith but when we are seperate our monolith to microservices this problem becomes general one 
as there are bunch of technologes which is helping to sove thoose common problems that relate to comunications between services.
